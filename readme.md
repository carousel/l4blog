This is core blog implementated with laravel. All important aspects of web 2.0 application are present - from CRUD to security. From here you can move into different directions. Laravel is great for modular development so it is very easy to transform this app into for example e-commerce or social site. Basic concepts are common. I was using purchased Twitter Bootstrap design.
